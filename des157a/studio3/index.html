        <h1>The Game of Life (Unfair Game)</h1>
        <p>
            There are two players. The player whose turn it is rolls the dice. The total of the roll 
            is added to the current player's score, and if you roll non-one doubles,<br> you can roll again
            or pass. Rolling again after getting doubles (a doubles re-roll) has a higher chance of getting
            more points, but also a higher risk of rolling<br> snake eyes. A doubles re-roll, from
            either player, increases the risk/reward factor. This factor is reset once a player rolls snake
            eyes from a doubles re-roll.
        </p> 
        <p>Because life is unfair, if you roll two "ones" (snake eyes), you lose half of your points.</p>
