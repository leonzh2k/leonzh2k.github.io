            <h2>Good Modal Design</h2>
            <p>
                I recently read an article titled "Best Practices for Modals"
                by Naema Baskanderi on the UX Planet Website. As the title 
                would suggest, it went over best practices for modals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking as a user, I do find it annoying when I'm browsing
                a site and a modal pops up unexpectedly. For example, I was
                on GeeksForGeeks and a modal for signing up popped up. 
                Apparently, you have to register to be able to view articles,
                which sucks. It also sucked because it let you browse for 
                around 10 seconds before the modal pops up, which fools you
                into thinking there's no signup required. At least make it 
                pop up immediately...
            </p>
            <p>
                As for whether I agree or disagree with the tips given, I'll
                have to say I agree with them, and I can't really give my own
                justifications as to why. These best practices likely are the 
                result of extensive UX research, and I'm not an UX expert, so 
                I'll take their word for it.

            <h2>Good Form Design</h2>
            <p>
                I recently read an article titled “Best practices for form design” 
                by Salim Ansari on the UX Collective website. In summary, it went 
                over general ways to design a form and implement different form 
                elements that would make the user experience as good as possible. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I agreed with all of its points, and there were some things 
                that I could definitely relate to with my own experience of filling 
                out online forms. For example, the point about providing a 
                ‘show password’ option. When creating a new account on some online service, 
                I’ve often had to confirm my password after entering it once. I sometimes get it 
                wrong, especially when I use a complex password. In those cases, a ‘show password’ 
                option would be really nice. Another recommendation from the article was to break 
                up the form into multiple steps. I have also personally encountered this in the wild, 
                and the web designer that designed the React app in ECS 162 did this as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think I've ever encountered a website form that exemplifies best practices.
                So I will talk about a form I filled out recently, which was a housing application.
                One thing it got right was breaking up the application into chunks and showing the
                remaining steps left. Another was asking the easy question first. The first few 
                questions were all questions I could answer off the top of my head, and the last
                few questions were things that required additional work like insurance. Unfortunately
                I can't link the form since it requires user login.
