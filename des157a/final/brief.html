                        <p>
                            The first website is w3schools' TryIt Editor. The interface design is very minimal, which
                            is good since it is very easy to figure out where all the main functions of the code editor 
                            are. In terms of interaction design, there are various ways that users can customize their
                            experience. For example, they are allowed to change the theme of the page and change orientation
                            and resize the output webpage. There are tooltips on hover on each setting to let users know
                            their function. There are also multiple ways to accomplish something; the aforementioned 
                            customizations can be changed directly on the toolbar or in the dropdown menu. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One thing the website gets right is ease of operation. It is very clear how to use the site.
                            I do have some criticisms, however. There is an advertisement for w3schools' website builder at
                            the top right. While not distracting, that space could be used for something more useful. Also,
                            the "save code" option only saves the code to an online service, which requires an account. 
                            In my opinion, they should add an option to just download the code to your computer.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Comparison Project 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second website is CodersEditor.com. This interface design is less minimal than the first
                        comparison project, which is understandable since this editor offers support for multiple languages
                        compared to w3schools' editor which only supports HTML/CSS and JS. In terms of interactions,
                        the user can choose which language they want, create a new file, share the file, run the program
                        (obviously). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have more criticisms of this site than the previous one. First, the settings button next to
                        "select programming language" doesn't work. Second, clicking "new file" seems to just refresh
                        the page and delete your existing file. Most people would expect this to open a new file 
                        in a new tab in the editor (like in VS Code), but it doesn't do that at all. As a result,
                        it can actually harm user experience since the actual result is different from the user 
                        expectation, and it could erase people's hard work without any warning.
    
                        Also, there is too much space devoted to things that are not relevant
                        to the code editor. For example, the sidebar is just advertising tutorials and other tools. As 
                        a result, the actual code editor only takes up around 70% of the screen.

                    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        The original project showed how for loops are structured in JavaScript. My
                        main goal this time around is to show how for loops are structured in languages
                        other than JavaScript. If I have time, I might add support for other programming
                        constructs, but it's unlikely.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        This project (and the original) differs from w3schools' code editor in that 
                        w3schools' editor allows you to write any valid HTML, CSS, and JS and the output
                        will be an entire working webpage. Obviously, that was too complex for my project,
                        which only runs JS code, and even that is severely limited in its capability, 
                        as most of the output is hardcoded and the user can only change it in small ways.
                        Also, this project will involve languages other than HTML/CSS and JS.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        This project (and the original) differs from CodersEditor.com in that the latter
                        supports writing programs in a variety of languages. Mine will also support
                        a variety of languages, but the selection is more limited, and again, the 
                        code output is mostly hardcoded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In summary, the biggest difference between my project and the two examples is that
                        the latter are full-fledged code IDEs, while mine is not.

                    <p>
                        Overall, this project is going to look pretty much the same as the original, except
                        it will have some additional features. These new features won't require a rehaul
                        of the basic structure of the webpage content, or a rehaul of any visual details.
                        Essentially, the new features will stay in line with the existing theme of the webpage.

                    <p>
                        To implement support for multiple languages I'll definitely need a select input element
                        that users can interact with to select their desired language. After they select a language,
                        the code should switch to that language's style of code.

                    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        I want users to learn about how for loops work and how different programming languages 
                        implement them. So I'll need to let users choose from multiple languages using an input element
                        and change the code shown with JS.
