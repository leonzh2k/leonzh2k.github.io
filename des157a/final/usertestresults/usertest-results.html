        <h2>Observation 1</h2>
        <p>
            A major observation was that users that did not have as much experience
            with programming struggled with getting the code to run without errors.
            Even with the error messages, they had trouble inputting the correct datatypes.
        </p>
        <h2>Observation 2</h2>
        <p>
            Another observation was that the select language option could be a bit too
            hard to notice for some people. One user didn't even register that it was an 
            option, which might be due to bad design.
        </p>
        <h2>Observation 3</h2>
        <p>
            Another observation was that I noticed that the webpage might not be
            very interesting or engaging to use. 
        </p>

        <h2>Updating Final Project Plans</h2>
        <p>
            I have a few ideas on how to update my project. First, to help
            users less experienced with programming, I could add more hints on 
            what they should input. I could add inline comments that explain the 
            exact syntax of what they are supposed to input. 

            To make the select language box more obvious, I could change the color
            scheme to make it stand out more or change its positioning.

            To make the webpage more interesting, I could display some ASCII art
            in the terminal when code isn't being run, to make it at least a bit more
            interesting.
